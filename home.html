                    Shri S. Somanath, Chairman, ISRO/ Secretary, Department of Space (DOS) and Dr. Salvador Landeros Ayala, Director General of Mexican Space Agency (AEM) had a virtual meeting on December 21, 2022.
                    <br><br>Dr. Pankaj Sharma, Ambassador of India to Mexico and Mr. Gustavo A. Cabrera Rodriguez, Ambassador of Mexico for the Latin American and Caribbean Space Agency (ALCE) have also participated in the meeting.
                    <br><br>Both heads of the agencies discussed the ongoing cooperation activities mainly in earth observation. While thanking ISRO for developing a mobile application for forest fire monitoring and sharing it with Mexican Forest Department, AEM Chief sought India’s support in building and launching a remote sensing satellite for Mexico. ISRO will work on this proposal with MEA’s support. India’s interest in expanding space cooperation in the Latin American and Caribbean region through ALCE was also discussed.
                    <br><br><br><br>Dec 24, 2022<br><br>
                    CE-20 engine is successfully operated with a thrust level of 22t for a long duration of 650 s on December 23, 2022, at the Cryogenic Main Engine & Stage Test Facility of ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu. With this, the engine qualification for 20 t thrust level is also successfully completed for induction in flight. The CE20 engine is designed and developed by Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Valiamala, Kerala. The engine was operated with a 20.2t thrust level for the first 40 s, followed by an operation at 20t off-nominal zones) before operating it at 22.2 t for a duration of 435 s, by moving the thrust control valve. The mixture ratio and thrust control were in open-loop mode. During the test, the engine and the facility performed normally, and the required engine performance parameters were achieved as predicted. The engine used for this hot test had undergone 11 hot tests with a cumulative duration of 2720 s earlier. Thus, this engine has undergone 3370 s cumulative burn duration at different thrust & mixture ratio levels.
                    <br><br><br><br>Completion of UNNATI batch- 3
                    <br><br>The third batch of UNispace Nanosatellite Assembly & Training by ISRO (UNNATI) by URSC/ISRO was conducted between October 15, 2022, and December 15, 2022. Thirty-one participants from 19 countries attended the training.
                    <br><br>A total of 107 lectures were organized in two major parts: 70 lectures on general satellite technology and 37 lectures on nanosatellite design and testing. The faculty comprised of experts from various centers of ISRO namely URSC, SAC, ISRO HQ, ISTRAC, and IISU. The lecture sessions, which began on October 17, 2022, got concluded with an interactive session chaired by Director, URSC on November 18, 2022.
                    <br><br>During the hands-on training sessions that commenced on November 21, 2022, the participants were divided into three teams. Each team was given the opportunity to integrate various subsystems of a nanosatellite. This was followed by training on disassembled mode tests, panel closure, and assembled mode tests. The sessions concluded with antenna and solar panel deployment and thermal implementation. The teams made a presentation to a review committee on their learning and takeaways from the sessions. 
                    <br><br>Participants visited the facilities at the ISITE campus of URSC covering cleanroom, checkout, CATF, CATVAC, and HILs on December 14, 2022. The rich cultural heritage of India was presented to the participants through a Bharatanatyam performance involving expressive songs and dances.
                    <br><br>The valedictory session was held at URSC on December 15, 2022. Chairman ISRO and Director URSC presided over the function, with Joint Secretary (Economic Diplomacy) MEA, Govt of India as the Chief Guest. Chairman, ISRO thanked the participants and hoped that they remain connected with URSC/ISRO as their Alma Mater.
                    <br><br>The Chief Guest congratulated URSC/ISRO for the successful conduct of the program and wished the participants to score high in their space endeavor.
                    <br><br>The participants appreciated the programme and ascertained that it was the knowledge enriching and memorable. They opined that the program, in addition to helping them gain technical knowledge, helped them get along with people of different backgrounds, cultures, and countries.
